      "\u001b[36m\u001b[1mYoshi: \u001b[22mHello there, my young friend! It's-a me, Yoshi! I'm so excited to tell you an adventurous story in the Mushroom Kingdom with Super Mario, Daisy, and Donkey Kong. So hold on tight and let's dive into this colorful tale!  Once upon a time, on a sunny day in the Mushroom Kingdom, Mario received a letter from Princess Peach. She was inviting him and his friends to a grand celebration at her castle. Of course, Mario couldn't resist! He quickly gathered Daisy and Donkey Kong, and off they went on their journey.  As they arrived at Peach's castle, they were greeted with cheers and smiles. The celebration was in full swing! There were Toads dancing, delicious cakes, and even a magic show by the famous Magikoopa. But little did they know that Bowser had sneaky plans up his spiky shell.  Suddenly, the ground started shaking, and Bowser burst into the castle with his Koopa Troopas. He snatched Princess Peach and whisked her away to his fiery fortress: Bowser's Castle! Mario knew he had to rescue her, so he bravely led his friends through forests, over mountains, and across treacherous lava pits until they reached the menacing castle.  Inside the castle's dark corridors, they encountered tricky traps and cunning enemies. But fear not! Yoshi was there to lend a helping hand. With his flutter jump and swift tongue, he gobbled up enemies left and right, clearing the way for his friends. He even found some shiny power-ups hidden amongst the castle's nooks and crannies!  Finally, after overcoming countless obstacles, they reached the throne room where Bowser awaited them. He laughed wickedly as he threw fireballs their way. But Mario was ready! With each fireball dodged or jumped over, he grew stronger and more determined.  Then came the main event - a colossal battle between Mario and Bowser. They clashed, jumping and throwing fireballs at each other. It was a fierce showdown! But with Daisy's encouragement and Donkey Kong's mighty punches, Mario managed to defeat Bowser and rescue Princess Peach once again!  With Bowser defeated and his castle crumbling around them, our heroes made their escape. They returned to Peach's castle, where they were hailed as true champions. The celebration resumed with even more joy and laughter than before.  And so, my dear friend, the Mushroom Kingdom was saved once again thanks to the bravery and teamwork of\n",

I can't believe we made it through those tricky traps and defeated Bowser,' Luigi replied, his voice tinged with relief.  'Yippee! And did you see Yoshi in action? He was gobbling up enemies left and right!' Mario cheered, a wide grin on his face.  'Oh yeah, Yoshi was incredible! His flutter jump helped us cross those dangerous gaps, and his tongue was like a magic weapon against the Koopa Troopas,' Luigi added, admiration evident in his voice.  'Hehe, Yoshi sure knows how to lend a helping hand...or should I say, tongue?' Mario chuckled, the sound contagious.  'But what about Daisy? She was so brave throughout the entire journey. Her encouragement kept us going,' Luigi mentioned, a fondness in his tone.  'You're right, Luigi. Daisy's positivity and support were like sunshine on a cloudy day. We couldn't have done it without her,' Mario agreed warmly.  'And let's not forget Donkey Kong! His mighty punches saved us from many tight spots. It's amazing how strong he is,' Luigi remarked, awe present in his words.  'Mama-mia! Donkey Kong's strength is out of this world. We're lucky to have him as a friend,' Mario said appreciatively.  As they reminisced about their adventure, the brothers couldn't help but feel grateful for their amazing friends. They realized that it was their teamwork and friendship that made them unstoppable.

      "\u001b[36m\u001b[1mYoshi: \u001b[22mIn the eerie realm of King Boo's Haunted Yard, Luigi and Donkey Kong found themselves standing at the entrance, surrounded by mist and ghostly whispers. The moon shone brightly overhead, casting an ethereal glow on the spooky landscape.  Luigi, trembling slightly, clutched his Poltergust 3000 tightly. 'G-gosh, Donkey Kong, this place gives me the creeps! I-I hope we can find what we're looking for quickly.'  Donkey Kong, towering beside him with a confident grin, patted Luigi's back reassuringly. 'Don't worry, little buddy! We're a team, and together we can handle anything this haunted yard throws at us!'  As they cautiously ventured deeper into the eerie yard, they could hear faint giggles and rattling chains in the distance. The ground beneath their feet seemed to shift ever so slightly as if teasing them. Suddenly, a mischievous group of Goombas emerged from behind a gnarled tree.  'Uh-oh, looks like trouble is brewing!' Luigi exclaimed, his voice tinged with both excitement and nervousness.  But before the Goombas could make a move, Donkey Kong sprang into action. With a mighty swing of his fist, he sent the Goombas flying in all directions. Their high-pitched squeals echoed through the haunted yard as they disappeared into thin air.  'Nice one, DK! Your strength never ceases to amaze me,' Luigi cheered enthusiastically.  As they continued their exploration, they stumbled upon a group of Koopa Troopas lurking near a pool of shimmering water. The mischievous creatures noticed them and began launching shells in their direction.  Ducking and dodging with agility, Luigi managed to avoid most of the shells while Donkey Kong used his powerful arms to swat away the remaining ones. Together, they swiftly overcame the Koopa Troopas' relentless assault, sending them scurrying away in defeat.  Breathing a sigh of relief, Luigi turned to Donkey Kong with a grateful smile. 'Phew! Thanks for having my back, DK. We make an incredible team!'  Donkey Kong chuckled heartily. 'No problem, Luigi! That's what friends are for. Now let's keep exploring and see what other surprises King Boo has in store for us!'
